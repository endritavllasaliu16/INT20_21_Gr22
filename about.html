        <p ><span class="font2">Dream House Architecture was founded in 1994 with a commitment to making places better to live. We believe that architecture and design matter, and that through our work, we can make a positive difference in the world. We strive to create buildings that are not just things in themselves, but serve as catalysts for positive urban and social change.<br>
        With our integrated team of architects, interior designers, planners and engineers, we advocate for the people who are served by the spaces we design. We engage with our clients on a personal level, as both institutions and people, so we can help them do better what they do best.	<br>

    	    <h3>Designer</h3>
    	    <p>My experience is in the planning and design of civic, industrial, and healthcare facilities. I came to SF and MWA with a BSAS from the University of Wisconsin and a Masters from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign – I have a good Midwestern perspective on West Coast projects. My efforts have been focused on designing envelopes for the built environment, a skill that helps me develop exteriors that are robust and energy efficient while being aesthetically pleasing.
